We're no strangers to love<br/>
You know the rules and so do I<br/>
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of<br/>
You wouldn't get this from any other guy<br/>
<br/>
I just wanna tell you how I'm felling<br/>
Gotta make you understand<br/>
Never gonna give you up<br/>
Never gonna let you down<br/>
Never gonna run around<br/>
And desert you<br/>
Never gonna make you cry<br/>
Never gonna say goodbye<br/>
Never gonna tell a lie<br/>
And hurt you<br/>
<br/>
We've known eachother for so long<br/>
Your hearts been aching<br/>
But you're to shy to say it<br/>
Inside we both know whats been going on<br/>
We know the game and we're gonna play it<br/>
And if you ask me how I'm feeling<br/>
Don't tell me you're too blind to see<br/>
<br/>
Never gonna give you up<br/>
Never gonna let you down<br/>
Never gonna run around<br/>
And desert you<br/>
Never gonna make you cry<br/>
Never gonna say goodbye<br/>
Never gonna tell a lie<br/>
And hurt you<br/>
<br/>
Never gonna give you up<br/>
Never gonna let you down<br/>
Never gonna run around<br/>
And desert you<br/>
Never gonna make you cry<br/>
Never gonna say goodbye<br/>
Never gonna tell a lie<br/>
And hurt you<br/>
<br/>
Oooooooh<br/>
Give you up<br/>
Oooooooh<br/>
Give you up<br/>
Never gonna give, never gonna give!<br/>
Give you up<br/>
Never gonna give, never gonna give!<br/>
Give you up<br/>
<br/>
We've known eachother for so long<br/>
Your heart's been aching<br/>
But you're too shy to say it<br/>
Inside we both know what's been going on<br/>
We know the game and we're gonna play it<br/>
<br/>
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling<br/>
Gotta make you unerstand<br/>
Never gonna give you up<br/>
Never gonna let you down<br/>
Never gonna run around<br/>
And desert you<br/>
Never gonna make you cry<br/>
Never gonna say goodbye<br/>
Never gonna tell a lie<br/>
And hurt you<br/>
<br/>
Never gonna give you up<br/>
Never gonna let you down<br/>
Never gonna run around<br/>
And desert you<br/>
Never gonna make you cry<br/>
Never gonna say goodbye<br/>
Never gonna tell a lie<br/>
And hurt you<br/>
<br/>
Never gonna give you up<br/>
Never gonna let you down<br/>
Never gonna run around<br/>
And desert you<br/>
Never gonna make you cry<br/>
Never gonna say goodbye<br/>
Never gonna tell a lie<br/>
And hurt you...<br/>
