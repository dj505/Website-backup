Hello, like the changes I made? Eh? Wanna see all my messy HTML and CSS (code), I put code in brackets because HTML and CSS are pretty n00by programming languages,
if they are even ones at that. But anyway, here's a GitHub link to my source code and images, all original, made by me. <a href="https://github.com/1sammy/Website-backup">GitHub.com</a>.
I apologize to anyone attempting to use that link, GitHub and I had a fight last night and it decided to stop working.
Finally got GitHub working again, and the link should now be working once more, just had to unilstall and reinstall EVERYTHING. Not impressed GitHub.
And here is a link to Mr. DJ505's website: <a href="https://dj505gaming.wordpress.com/">wordpress.com</a>.
<br/>
As I spend more time attempting to make a passable website my respect for those who are highly fluent in HTML and CSS has started skyrocteting and my respect for their respective languages has increased by a factor or twenty or more. 
<br/>
A word of advisory, do not attempt to re-write all the CSS for your website during the middle of the night while listening to U2 and the Red Hot Chilli Peppers on full balst.
The results are not very much better when the same experiment is run with the Beatles instead of U2 and the RHCP.
Although Neil Diamond and Rick Astley seem to increase productivity when just working with plain HTML or PHP.
<br/>
If you wanna see what happens when a Rick Astley fan with a website gets bored at midnight go to the Rickroll page.
